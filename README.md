Playlister wraps the spotify API to perform simple playlist manipulations. This project is initially intended to be used for listening to a discord channel and adding songs in messages to a spotify playlist.

In the long term this should ideally allow someone to also work with other music platforms such as youtube/tidal/etc. and perform more complex operations, as well as keeping statistics and generally functioning as a layer of abstraction above the music platforms themselves.
